# Approved Methodologies

Verra methodologies outline detailed instructions for determining GHG emission reduction and removals for a wide variety of nature based solutions. The VCS program allows any methodology developed under the [United Nations Clean Development Mechanism](https://unfccc.int) as well as methodologies developed by the [Climate Action Reserve](https://www.climateactionreserve.org), with the exception of their forest protocols, to be used alongside their native methodologies.
