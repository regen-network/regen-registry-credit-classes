# Sectoral Scope

Regen Registry focuses exclusively on nature based solutions, or activities that protect, sustainably and/or regeneratively manage, restore natural or modified ecosystems. Projects focused on sustainable energy or energy savings, transportation, industrial process, construction, mining and industrial waste management are, while undoubtedly important, not the current focus of our program. With that in mind, VCS projects eligible for this credit class are restricted to those whose [VCS sectoral scope](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/projects-and-jnr-programs/vcs-sectoral-scopes/) is defined as one of the following:

* Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)
* Livestock and Manure Management
