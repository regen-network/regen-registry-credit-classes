# GHG Benefits in Managed Crop and Grassland Systems Credit Class

## Overview

**Developer:** Ecometric

**Offset Generation Method:** Carbon Removal

**Sectoral Scope:** Livestock and Manure Management

**Abstract:** Under managed grazing, emissions of the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide continue, but are more than offset by soil organic carbon sequestration (at least until soil carbon saturation is achieved). The estimated global benefit from managed grazing is between 16.4 and 26 Gt CO2e sequestered in the period between 2020-2050.

The intent of this Credit Class is to provide incentive and a structure to significantly increase the amount of hectares/acres under regenerative annual cropping and managed grazing worldwide by providing land stewards with the necessary incentives to make this important work possible.
